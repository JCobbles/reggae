# REGGaE: Regulation of Gene Expression

This library implements several Latent Force Models of transcriptional regulation. These are all implemented in building blocks simplifying the creation of novel models or combinations.

Both analytical and MCMC-based methods are implemented.

## Installation

`pip install tf-reggae`


## Examples

Open `example_analytical.ipynb` as a Jupyter notebook and run the cells. This is a replication of the analytical Linear Latent Force Model from Lawrence et al., 2006 (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3119-modelling-transcriptional-regulation-using-gaussian-processes.pdf)

The dataset required is small and is available preprocessed here:
